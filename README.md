Gotcha, Bright. Let’s strike the balance—detailed enough to be useful, written like a technically-savvy student documenting their process, but still keeping it practical and readable. Here's the expanded write-up:

## 🧠 Lex Chatbot Project Log: PersonalBanker

### 🔍 Objective

Build a chatbot using Amazon Lex that helps users check their bank balance. It should prompt them for an account type (Saving or Current) and a 4-digit PIN. If all goes well, it responds with their mock balance. Otherwise, it loops or errors appropriately.

---

### 🛠️ INTENT: `GetBalanceCheck`

- Created a new intent called `GetBalanceCheck`.
- This intent covers queries related to checking account balance.
- Added these utterances (as examples of what users might type):

  ```
  check my bank balance  
  how much money is in my account  
  how much money do i have
  ```

> ⚠️ I avoided punctuation at the end of sample utterances. Lex is picky here—it can throw build errors if they’re formatted like normal sentences.

### 📥 SLOTS

#### 1. `AccountType` (Custom Slot)

- Created a new custom slot type called `AccountType`.
- Values:  
  - `Saving`  
  - `Current`  
- Marked it as **required**, and added this prompt:
  
  ```
  What type of account do you want to check (Current or Savings)?
  ```

- Connected this to the `GetBalanceCheck` intent.

#### 2. `PinNumber` (Built-in Slot)

- Added another slot to the same intent.
- Used `AMAZON.FOUR_DIGIT_NUMBER` as the slot type.
- Gave it this prompt:

  ```
  What is your pin number for your {AccountType} account?
  ```

- Also marked as **required**.

> 🧠 Lex collects these slot values before it sends the data to any backend logic.

### 🎨 Response Cards (Optional UX Boost)

- For a more user-friendly experience (especially in chat UIs), I added response cards to the `AccountType` prompt.
- Gave users clickable buttons instead of making them type:
  - **Saving Account** → `Saving`
  - **Current Account** → `Current`

This helped guide inputs and avoid typos.

### 🔧 Back-End Logic – Lambda

**Function Name:** `myPersonalBanker`  
**Runtime:** Node.js 14.x  
**Permissions:** Gave it basic execution role with Lex permissions.

**Code File:** I used the script `myPersonalBanker_v1.js` from the project repo. Here’s what it does:
- Checks the intent name (`GetBalanceCheck`)
- Validates the PIN (must be `1234`)
- If valid, replies with a hardcoded mock balance (like `$4,362.50`)
- If invalid, gives an error message

> 🧪 The code includes a basic fallback that says “try again” if PINs don’t match—good for feedback loops.

---

### 🔗 Connecting Lex to Lambda

To actually make the bot _do something_, I linked the intent to the Lambda:

- Went into the `GetBalanceCheck` intent → scrolled to **Fulfillment**
- Selected **AWS Lambda function** and picked `myPersonalBanker`
- Hit OK on the permission prompt and saved the intent
- Then rebuilt the bot

Now, when users fill out the slots, Lex sends that data to the Lambda, which returns a response.

### 🧪 Testing the Flow

Sample test:

> User: What is my balance  
> Bot: What type of account do you want to check (Current or Savings)?  
> User: Saving  
> Bot: What is your pin number for your Saving account?  
> User: 1234  
> Bot: Your balance for the Saving account is $4,362.50

> User enters the wrong PIN?  
> Bot responds with an error and asks again.

> I updated the code by commenting/uncommenting different `return` statements depending on whether I wanted to return a success, an error, or just a placeholder.

```js
// return simpleResponse(intentRequest, callback);
// return balanceIntentError(intentRequest, callback);
return balanceIntent(intentRequest, callback);
```

### 🧾 Summary & Key Learnings

- Defined intents and slots cleanly to guide user input
- Added response cards for a more polished chat experience
- Used Lambda to simulate basic security logic (PIN check)
- Learned how Lex and Lambda pass data between them
- Understood slot order, validation, and response flow

---

Next step: I might extend this to query a database or plug into an AWS service like RDS or DynamoDB instead of returning static values.
