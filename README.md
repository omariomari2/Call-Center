# PersonalBanker Call Center – AWS Lex + Amazon Connect

A scalable, cloud-native voice banking system built with AWS Lex and Amazon Connect to simulate real-world banking experiences through AI-driven interactions.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

**PersonalBanker** is a practical experiment in building secure, serverless, and voice-enabled cloud solutions. The system allows callers to authenticate via PIN, speak naturally to a Lex bot, and retrieve mock account information—all orchestrated via AWS Lambda and routed through Amazon Connect.

This prototype is built for rapid iteration, modular growth, and production-grade scalability.

## ☁️ Why Cloud Services

My focus is on designing cloud-native solutions that are secure, scalable, and user-aware. This project reflects how managed services like Lex, Lambda, and Connect can work in harmony to power intelligent, low-maintenance customer service systems.

It serves as a foundation for future cloud projects that deliver real impact, from underrepresented communities to enterprise-grade deployments.

## 📝 Notes from Me

This isn’t just a school project—it’s a real cloud solution built from the ground up. Every component was designed with scalability, automation, and learning in mind. I’m using this project to showcase how voice interfaces and serverless infrastructure can redefine user interaction.

> “Build it once, scale it forever. That’s the power of cloud.”
